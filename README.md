Hello My name is Roji P Babu,
This repos wil be including my beginner project as a data scientist training. I know its a long way to go but Consistency is the key. Everyday for atleast one hour I am spending it for learing python, machine learning, Deep learning.
Not for getting a good career out of it, But for the passion.
Since I am doing my MBA right now, most of my projects will be of the finance based and Stock market related.
I know there will be somebody there who are confused where to start and the answer start somewhere thats the whole point, Make Mistakes Learn from the mistake, Understand the concept. Use your Knowledge.
You Got This.
Thank you
